# Inflation of an idealised ventricle

## Overview

This case is defined as problem 2 in [Land et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4707707).

The material model is the Guccione incompressible hyperelastic law, a special case of the Fung orthotropic incompressible hyperelastic law; for example, see the [FEBio benchmarks](https://febio.org/knowledgebase/case-studies/structural-mechanics/cardiac-mechanics-benchmark-problems).
