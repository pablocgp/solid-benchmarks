# Rubber Sealing

Prepared by Ivan Batistić and Philip Cardiff

## Overview

This benchmark case examines the compression of a rubber seal, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The material behaviour is modelled using a compressible hyperelastic Ogden model (third order). Material bulk modulus is $\kappa=1000$ N/mm$^2$  and the remaining material parameters are as follows:
$$
\mu_1 = 0.63 ~\text{N/mm}^2, \quad \mu_2 = 0.0012 ~\text{N/mm}^2, \quad \mu_3 = -0.01 ~\text{N/mm}^2, \qquad \alpha_1=1.3, \quad \alpha_2=5, \quad \alpha_3=-2
$$
The upper surface undergoes a prescribed displacement of $2.2$ mm, applied incrementally over $100$ equally spaced steps, while the bottom surface remains fixed. To exploit symmetry, only half of the seal is modelled.  The problem is solved as 2D assuming plane strain conditions. Given the complexity of the displacement and stress fields near the corners of the seal, numerical instabilities may occur during the simulation.

### Expected Results

The deformed sealing, coloured with equivalent stress, is shown in Fig. 2. Side-by-side comparison is made with results from [2]. Unlike in [1] and [3], where the Ogden material model is used, [2] employs the Yeoh material model with the following parameters: $c_1 = 0.31237237$ MPa, $c_2 = 0.00054257$ MPa, and $c_3 = 0.00006962$ MPa.
