## Case overview

Two thick-walled hollow concentric half-spheres are compressed between two rigid planes. Due to the geometric and the load symmetry, the computational model is modelled in quarter symmetry. The geometry of the computational model is shown in Fig. 1. The contact between the lower rigid plane and the inner sphere as well as contact between the upper rigid plane and the outer sphere is modelled as frictionless. For the contact between two spheres, two different coefficients of friction are considered ($$\mu = 0$$ and $$\mu = 0.5$$). The displacement of the upper rigid plane $$u_z = 10$$ mm is prescribed within $$100$$ equal displacement increments. The material property of both spheres is the same ($$E = 1$$ MPa and $$\nu = 0.3$$). The problem is solved by neglecting gravitational and inertial forces.

```warning
The case is set using foam-extend 4.1. 
Other versions of the OpenFOAM may require some small tweaks.

## Benchmark purpose

* To test solver when using hyperelastic mechanical law  (large deformations) with large sliding frictional contact.

## Expected results

* With coarser mesh, the outer sphere is less prone to buckling [1], see Figure 2. The same conclusion can be drawn by analysing results from the literature, as some authors reported the occurrence of buckling of the outer sphere and some did not.

- Figure 3 show the evolution of the compression force for the frictional case. The compression force before buckling of the inner sphere matches well with the results from the literature. After the start of the inner sphere buckling, a difference exists in the evolution of the compression force and the structure shows less stiffness in `solids4foam`.
